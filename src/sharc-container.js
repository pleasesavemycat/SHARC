/**
 * @fileoverview SHARC Container Library
 *
 * Production-ready container-side implementation for the SHARC protocol.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *   - Creating and managing the secure iframe rendering context
 *   - Running the container side of the SHARC protocol lifecycle
 *   - Enforcing the Page-Lifecycle-aligned state machine
 *   - Owning close, navigation, placement change, and tracker operations
 *   - Managing the MessageChannel handshake
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *   - sharc-protocol.js (must be loaded first, or required via CommonJS)
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```javascript
 * const container = new SHARCContainer({
 *   creativeUrl: 'https://ads.example.com/creative.html',
 *   placementElement: document.getElementById('ad-slot'),
 *   environmentData: { ... },
 *   extensions: [new OmidCompatBridge({ partnerName: 'MyPublisher', partnerVersion: '1.0' })],
 *   onStateChange: (state) => console.log('State:', state),
 *   onClose: () => document.getElementById('ad-slot').remove(),
 * });
 * container.load();
 * ```
 *
 * @version 0.7.11

/**
 * Answered probe-cycle rate ceiling for `_armRendererBackstop` (#332, Phase 2 of
 * the post-render nav policy — `docs/design/0.7.10-post-render-nav-policy-omid-phase.md`).
 *
 * Phase 1 (#321) gates EVERY post-render renderer-frame load through the
 * authenticated loadProbe/loadAck round-trip, and each ANSWERED cycle emits one
 * `console.info` + one `renderer_load_observed` `onSecurityEvent` callback. A
 * renderer that answers the probe on every load cycle can therefore drive an
 * unbounded `load → runGate → renderer_load_observed` churn — a keep-alive /
 * log-volume DoS-adjacent window. This ceiling bounds BOTH the log volume and
 * the keep-alive-abuse surface WITHOUT killing a legitimate-but-chatty renderer.
 *
 * The bound is a sliding-window RATE cap, not a lifetime cap: at most
 * `PROBE_CYCLE_CEILING_MAX` answered cycles per `PROBE_CYCLE_CEILING_WINDOW_MS`.
 * On the (MAX+1)th answered cycle inside the window the backstop classifies the
 * renderer as abusively chatty and THROTTLES — it suppresses further
 * `renderer_load_observed` emissions and emits the reserved non-terminating
 * `renderer_navigation_blocked` (2122) diagnostic exactly once on the threshold
 * crossing. It does NOT terminate: Decision 0/2 keep the ad alive while SHARC
 * holds the channel; 2118 stays reserved for lost-control (gate unanswered).
 *
 * Why these values, and why CONSTANTS (not construction options): with the
 * inherited 100ms loadAck deadline a maximally abusive renderer can drive at
 * most ~10 answered cycles/second, so a 10s window caps a flood near ~100 cycles
 * — `MAX = 20` trips a flood well before that while staying far above any
 * legitimate bootstrap pattern (the DV corpus showed 1–2 controlled reopens per
 * ad; measurement/MRAID/OMID bootstraps add at most a handful). This is a
 * security/DoS ceiling, not a behavior a renderer should be able to negotiate
 * upward — so it is a fixed constant, mirroring the hardcoded 100ms probe
 * deadline, not a `timeouts`-style option.
 *
 * Accepted residual: because this is a RATE cap (≤MAX answered cycles per
 * window), NOT a lifetime/volume cap, a renderer that paces itself just under
 * the ceiling (~MAX-1 answered cycles/window) sustains a low steady diagnostic
 * rate for the entire ad lifetime and never trips 2122. This is accepted and
 * deliberate. Each answered cycle is a semantically-honest "controlled load
 * observed" signal — not a forgery — so the residual is a bounded log-rate
 * cost, not a security bypass. A lifetime/volume cap is explicitly REJECTED: it
 * would eventually throttle a legitimately long-lived or chatty renderer (long
 * video, repeated OMID/MRAID reopens) and blind operators to genuine late-life
 * signal. The sliding window is the intended tradeoff — bound the burst rate,
 * keep honest late-life observability. (A suppressed-count surfaced on the 2122
 * diagnostic was considered and deferred to Phase-2 intent classification.)

 *     rejected (404, MIME mismatch, network failure, evaluation throw, or

 *     (issue #82) per the 5 Security Engineer guardrails.
 *   - `unauthorized_navigation` — terminating (RENDERER_UNAUTHORIZED_NAVIGATION
 *     2118); load-event backstop detected a renderer navigation outside the
 *     SHARC protocol path.
 *   - `feature_load_failed` — non-terminating; an extension's load-time
 *     asset (e.g. the OM SDK script for `OmidCompatBridge`) failed to
 *     load on the publisher page. Sibling to `bridge_load_failed` (which

   * @param {string} [options.creativeUrl] - URL of the SHARC-enabled creative HTML
   *   (Creative URL variant). Mutually exclusive with `creativeHtml`. Exactly one
   *   of `creativeUrl` or `creativeHtml` MUST be provided. Empty string (`''`) is
   *   treated as "not provided" — same as `undefined`/`null`.
   * @param {string} [options.creativeHtml] - Raw HTML markup for the creative
   *   (Creative Markup variant — added in 0.7.0). Mutually exclusive with
   *   `creativeUrl`. Requires `creativeRendererUrl`. Posted to the operator-hosted
   *   renderer page via the renderer protocol. Capped at 256 KiB at construction
   *   (pre-injection); see proposal § Validation Rules. Empty string (`''`) is
   *   treated as "not provided" — same as `undefined`/`null`.
   * @param {string} [options.creativeRendererUrl] - HTTPS URL of an operator-hosted
   *   renderer page. Required when `creativeHtml` is provided; forbidden alongside
   *   `creativeUrl`. Must parse via `new URL(...)`, use the `https:` scheme
   *   (except `http:` localhost-style renderer URLs when the publisher origin is
   *   also a recognized dev origin), contain no userinfo, and be cross-origin to
   *   both `window.location` and (when accessible) `window.top.location`. See
   *   proposal § Validation Rules. Empty string (`''`) is treated as "not provided."
   * @param {string} [options.creativeRendererIntegrity] - Optional SRI-style
   *   SHA-384 digest for the operator-hosted renderer page, in the form
   *   `sha384-<base64>`. Creative Markup only. When provided, the container
   *   fetches `creativeRendererUrl`, computes SHA-384 over the response bytes,
   *   and refuses to assign `iframe.src` or send `SHARC:Renderer:render` when
   *   the digest mismatches or the bytes cannot be verified. This is a
   *   best-effort preflight because browsers do not support native
   *   `integrity=` enforcement on iframes; operators should still serve the
   *   renderer from immutable versioned URLs with strong CDN controls and CORS
   *   headers that allow publisher-side fetch verification.
   * @param {SHARCSecurityEventCallback} [options.onSecurityEvent] - Callback fired
   *   with a {@link SHARCSecurityEvent} for security-relevant events (wrapper carve-out,
   *   origin mismatch, renderer protocol failure, etc.). Production observability hook.
   *   Synchronous; throws are caught and logged. Console output continues regardless
   *   of whether the callback is provided. See proposal § Security Model.
   * @param {boolean} [options.allowPopups=true] - When `true` (default), the Creative
   *   Markup renderer iframe sandbox includes both `allow-popups` AND
   *   `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox`. When `false`, both tokens are omitted; creative
   *   `window.open()` calls fail at the browser level. `SHARC.requestNavigation()` works
   *   regardless. The `allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox` token is bound to this option
   *   (DD-21); not exposed separately.
   * @param {boolean} [options.allowTopNavigationByUserActivation=true] - When `true`
   *   (default), the renderer iframe sandbox includes `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation`,
   *   permitting user-gesture-initiated `<a target="_top">` clicks. When `false`, the
   *   token is omitted. The unsafe `allow-top-navigation` token (no-gesture variant) is
   *   never exposed. See DD-20.
   * @param {boolean} [options.allowStorageAccessByUserActivation=true] - When `true`
   *   (default), the renderer iframe sandbox includes
   *   `allow-storage-access-by-user-activation`, permitting `document.requestStorageAccess()`
   *   on user gesture. When `false`, the token is omitted and SAA calls fail. See DD-22.
   * @param {boolean} [options.allowModals=false] - When `true`, the renderer iframe
   *   sandbox includes `allow-modals`. Default `false` — modals are an opt-in operator
   *   control, not a baseline capability. See DD-23.
   * @param {boolean} [options.allowDownloads=false] - When `true`, the renderer iframe
   *   sandbox includes `allow-downloads`. Default `false` — direct iframe downloads are
   *   an opt-in operator control. See DD-25.
   * @param {'warn'|'block'} [options.wrapperPolicy='warn'] - Controls container behavior
   *   when validation rule 7's wrapper-cross-origin carve-out applies (cross-origin top
   *   frame inaccessible at construction). `'warn'` (default) emits `console.warn` +
   *   `onSecurityEvent` and proceeds. `'block'` emits `console.error` + `onSecurityEvent`
   *   and throws synchronously at construction. See DD-19 and proposal § Security Model
   *   § wrapper-cross-origin.
   * @param {string[]|null} [options.bridges] - **Creative Markup variant only**
   *   (paired with `creativeHtml`). Passing `bridges` alongside `creativeUrl`
   *   throws synchronously (Rule 3b) — the Creative URL variant does not load
   *   bridges (no renderer protocol). Explicit list of compatibility-bridge
   *   identifiers the renderer should load alongside the creative HTML. When
   *   provided, overrides the auto-detection pipeline (`creativeMeta.apis` → adm
   *   content scan). Reserved identifiers in 0.7.1: `'mraid'`, `'safeframe'`.
   *   Pass `[]` to explicitly suppress all bridge loading (e.g., a static-image
   *   creative the operator has classified). Pass `null` (or omit) to use
   *   auto-detection. Validated as `null | string[]`; contents validated against
   *   the reserved set — unknown identifiers throw. Resolved value is reflected
   *   on the `bridges` field of the `SHARC:Renderer:render` message and exposed
   *   as `container.bridges`.
   *   See `docs/design/0.7.1-bridges-field.md` § 3 Container-side detection.
   * @param {{apis?: number[], measurement?: {omid?: Object}}} [options.creativeMeta]
   *   - Bid-side metadata used by layer 2 of the bridge auto-detection
   *   pipeline and by measurement sidecars. `creativeMeta.apis` is an array of AdCOM
   *   `APIFramework` integer codes
   *   (https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/AdCOM/blob/master/AdCOM%20v1.0%20FINAL.md#list--api-frameworks-).
   *   For OpenRTB 2.6 sources `bid.apis` maps directly. For pre-2.6 sources
   *   where the field is the deprecated singular `bid.api` (single integer),
   *   normalize at the call site: `creativeMeta: { apis: bid.apis ?? (typeof bid.api === 'number' ? [bid.api] : bid.api ?? []) }`.
   *   Recognized in 0.7.1: 3/5/6 (MRAID 1.0/2.0/3.0) → `'mraid'`. Code 7 (OMID 1.0)
   *   is reserved for 0.7.2; SafeFrame has no AdCOM enum yet (detected via adm
   *   scan in 0.7.1). Vendor-specific codes (500+) ignored. Forward-compatible
   *   bag — future bid-side fields land in this same object without growing the
   *   constructor surface. On Creative URL variant, `creativeMeta` does not
   *   load renderer bridges and does not set `apiFramework`, but may carry
   *   `creativeMeta.measurement.omid` for bid-signaled OMID auto-installation
   *   when paired with `omidAutoInstall`.
   *   See `docs/design/0.7.1-bridges-field.md` § 3.2.
   * @param {Object|null} [options.omidAutoInstall] - Optional operator-owned
   *   OMID auto-install defaults. When `creativeMeta.apis` contains AdCOM
   *   `7` (OMID 1.0) and `creativeMeta.measurement.omid.verificationScripts`
   *   is present, the container appends an `OmidCompatBridge` extension built
   *   from this object plus the bid-declared OMID sidecar. This option is the
   *   source for trusted OM SDK URLs (`omSdkServiceScriptUrl`,
   *   `omSdkSessionClientUrl`) and partner defaults; bid metadata supplies
   *   verification resources and optional OMID session descriptors. Missing or
   *   invalid sidecar data warns and continues without installing OMID.
   * @param {string} [options.creativeSdkUrl] - Operator-hosted `sharc-creative.js` URL.
   *   When set, the container auto-injects a `<script src="...sharc-creative.js"></script>`
   *   tag into Markup-variant creative HTML at load time, lifting legacy adm
   *   (plain HTML / MRAID / SafeFrame creatives that don't know about SHARC)
   *   into the SHARC runtime without per-creative changes.
   *
   *   Pattern: operators ingesting OpenRTB bids from third-party DSPs receive
   *   `bid.adm` that wasn't built against SHARC. Setting one constructor option
   *   is the difference between "creative loads but no handshake" and "creative
   *   handshakes, bridges install, full SHARC observability." This is the
   *   dominant operator integration pattern for the Markup variant — wiring
   *   the SDK at the container level instead of per-creative or via separate
   *   extensions removes the speculation about whether operators will opt in.
   *
   *   Injection position (4-step, most-specific-wins): after `<head>` → after
   *   `<html>` → after `<!DOCTYPE>` → prepend. The doctype branch inserts AFTER
   *   the declaration (not before) — prepending would push the browser into
   *   quirks-mode and subtly break legacy creatives.
   *
   *   Creative URL variant (0.7.4): supported via `_fetchAndInjectCreative()`
   *   when the operator also passes `useMarkupInjection: true`. The container
   *   fetches the creative URL, runs the built-in injector FIRST (mirroring
   *   the Markup-variant ordering contract — operator `injectIntoMarkup()`
   *   extensions see the markup with the SDK already present), and loads the
   *   result via `iframe.srcdoc`. **Explicit opt-in only:** without
   *   `useMarkupInjection: true`, the URL variant continues to load via
   *   `iframe.src` — passing `creativeSdkUrl` alone is a no-op on URL variant
   *   (so operators sharing constructor config across Markup and URL bid
   *   variants don't see iframe-loading semantics flip from `src` to `srcdoc`
   *   under them). Fetch failures (CORS, 404, transport) emit a
   *   `console.warn` and fall through to the un-injected `iframe.src` load;
   *   no SHARCSecurityEvent fires (a fetch failure is a transport concern,
   *   not a feature-load failure). The
   *   `com.iabtechlab.sharc.creative-injector` feature is advertised only
   *   when injection actually ran (Markup: always when `creativeSdkUrl` is
   *   set; URL: only after a successful fetch + inject) — no capability lie.
   *
   *   Throws `TypeError` (Rule 12) when provided as anything other than a
   *   non-empty string. No coercion of numbers/objects/booleans. See 0.7.2
   *   design § 6.3; 0.7.4 design § 2.1 (URL-variant parity, #106).
   * @param {boolean} [options.creativeSdkSkipIfPresent=true] - Idempotency guard
   *   for the built-in SDK injection. When `true` (default), markup already
   *   containing a `<script src="...sharc-creative.js">` tag passes through
   *   unchanged. The script-src context is required — bare substring presence
   *   in HTML comments, `<meta content="...">`, or inline-script text does NOT
   *   trigger the skip (closes the silent-no-op footgun where a comment caused
   *   the SDK to never load and bridge auto-install to time out).
   *
   *   Set `false` to force injection (versioned-SDK coexistence test rigs,
   *   debug-instrumented overlays, etc.). No-op when `creativeSdkUrl` is unset.
   *   See 0.7.2 design § 6.3.
   * @param {Object} [options.creativeSdkScriptAttrs={}] - Additional `<script>`
   *   attributes for the auto-injected SDK tag. Defaults to `{}` — a bare
   *   `<script src="...">` element (parser-blocking, synchronous), which is
   *   the ONLY attribute set that prevents the inline-`mraid.*` race condition
   *   for legacy MRAID creatives. Inline MRAID creatives invoke `mraid.*` calls
   *   immediately during parser execution; `async` / `defer` defer the SDK load
   *   past those calls and they vanish into ReferenceError.
   *
   *   Serialization (React-style): `true` → bare attribute (` async`); `false`
   *   / `null` / `undefined` → omitted entirely; strings → quoted attribute
   *   with HTML escaping (`&` → `&amp;`, `"` → `&quot;`, `<` → `&lt;`) to
   *   defend against attribute-injection when operator pipelines thread
   *   user-derived data through these values. The `creativeSdkUrl` `src=`
   *   attribute is escaped identically.
   *
   *   Operators with fully event-driven pipelines (no inline MRAID calls) can
   *   pass `{ async: true }`, `{ defer: true }`, `{ integrity: 'sha384-...' }`,
   *   etc. No-op when `creativeSdkUrl` is unset. See 0.7.2 design § 6.3.
   * @param {HTMLElement} [options.placementElement] - The DOM element to insert the iframe into.
   *   (Previously named `containerEl` — `containerEl` is no longer accepted. Use `placementElement` instead.)
   * @param {string|null} [options.placementId] - Publisher-supplied placement identifier.
   *   Round-trips through the constructor so the instance exposes `container.placementId`.
   *   Omitting the option or passing `''` both result in `null`.
   * @param {string|null} [options.placementName] - Human-readable placement name.
   *   Round-trips through the constructor so the instance exposes `container.placementName`.
   *   Omitting the option or passing `''` both result in `null`.
   * @param {Object} [options.environmentData] - Environment data to pass in Container:init.
   *   @param {Object} [options.environmentData.currentPlacement] - Placement dimensions.
   *   @param {Object} [options.environmentData.dataspec] - AdCOM or custom dataspec info.
   *   @param {Object} [options.environmentData.data] - Data from the dataspec.
   *   @param {Object} [options.environmentData.containerNavigation] - Navigation capabilities.
   *   @param {boolean} [options.environmentData.isMuted] - Whether audio is muted.
   *   @param {number} [options.environmentData.volume] - Volume level (0-1, or -1 if unknown).
   *   @param {Object} [options.environmentData.publisherContext] - Publisher environment context.
   *     @param {string} [options.environmentData.publisherContext.pageUrl] - Page URL (MRAID 3.0 pattern: "" if unavailable).
   *     @param {string} [options.environmentData.publisherContext.domain] - Domain ("" if unavailable).
   *     @param {string} [options.environmentData.publisherContext.bundleId] - App bundle ID ("" if unavailable).
   *     @param {string} [options.environmentData.publisherContext.platform] - "web"|"ios"|"android"|"ctv" ("" if unknown).
   * @param {Array<string | {name: string, version?: string}>} [options.supportedFeatures=[]] - Explicit feature descriptors this container supports.
   *   Accepts either plain feature name strings or descriptor objects; extra descriptor metadata is tolerated but ignored by the creative's built-in feature lookup.
   *   In practice, pass extensions instead — each extension contributes its feature name automatically. If creatives need descriptor metadata like `version`, pass descriptor objects explicitly.
   * @param {Object[]} [options.extensions=[]] - Extension plugin objects (e.g. OmidCompatBridge, MRAIDCompatBridge).
   *   Each extension may implement:
   *     - `getFeatureName()` → string  — added to supportedFeatures in Container:init
   *     - `injectIntoMarkup(html)` → string — called before iframe load to inject scripts into creative HTML
   *       (only used when options.useMarkupInjection=true — see below)
   *     - `onContainerLifecycleEvent(event)` — called with generic container
   *       lifecycle events (`load`, `stateChange`, `placementChange`, `close`,
   *       `error`, `destroy`) for extension-owned infrastructure
   *     - `onContainerStateChange(newState, previousState, container)` —
   *       backwards-compatible state-only hook
   *     - `destroy()` — called when the container is terminated
   * @param {boolean} [options.useMarkupInjection=false] - Opt-in: fetch the creative HTML, pipe it through
   *   each extension's injectIntoMarkup(), and load via srcdoc instead of src.
   *
   *   DEFAULT (Option 2 — recommended): OM SDK loads on the publisher page as a <script> tag.
   *   The container-side bridge manages the Session Client from the page context. No fetch, no srcdoc.
   *   Works across all origins. Matches the native SDK model (app owns OM SDK, not the creative).
   *
   *   ALTERNATIVE (Option 3 — same-origin only): Set useMarkupInjection=true when the creative URL
   *   is same-origin and CORS is not a constraint. Useful for test environments and publishers who
   *   control both the page and the creative server. Cross-origin creative URLs will fail to fetch
   *   and fall back to direct src loading (OM SDK will not be injected).
   * @param {Object} [options.timeouts] - Override default timeout values.
   * @param {Function} [options.onStateChange] - Called with (newState, previousState) on transition.
   * @param {Function} [options.onClose] - Called when the container has fully closed.
   * @param {Function} [options.onError] - Called with (errorCode, errorMessage) on fatal errors.
   * @param {Function} [options.onNavigation] - Observation-only hook called with
   *   (navigationArgs) when creative requests navigation. Return value is ignored.
   * @param {Function} [options.onOrientationProperties] - Observation-only hook called with
   *   ({forceOrientation, allowOrientationChange}) when the creative calls
   *   mraid.setOrientationProperties(), so a host SDK can drive the device orientation lock.
   *   Observation-only; thrown errors are swallowed. Omit for the default (no-op) behaviour.
   * @param {Function} [options.onInteraction] - Called with (trackingUris) when creative reports interaction.
   * @param {Function} [options.onMessage] - Called with every received message (for debugging/logging).
   * @param {boolean} [options.autoStart=true] - If true, calls startCreative automatically after init resolves.
   * @param {boolean} [options.visible=false] - Initial iframe visibility. Set to false to preload silently.
   * @param {Object} [options.placementPolicy] - Placement-policy object that constrains creative-driven
   *   placement requests (resize / expand / fullscreen / collapse). When provided, requestPlacementChange
   *   args are validated against allowed intents, dimension limits, and close-region requirements before
   *   any DOM mutation. When omitted, placement requests bypass policy validation entirely.
   * @param {Object} [options.closeButtonStyles] - CSS overrides for the auto-rendered close button.
   *   Keys map to the close button element's style properties (e.g. `top`, `right`, `width`).
   * @param {boolean} [options.requireSharcInit=true] - When `true` (default), the container arms the
   *   `createSession` timeout exactly as in 0.7.1: a creative that fails to handshake within
   *   `timeouts.createSession` ms fatal-errors with `ErrorCodes.NO_CREATE_SESSION` (2212). When
   *   `false`, the timeout is not armed; non-SHARC creatives (generic HTML banners, mixed inventory,
   *   validator tooling) load to a stable, queryable, terminable container instance without timing
   *   out. SHARC-aware creatives still handshake normally when this is `false` — the option only
   *   affects the missing-handshake path. Throws `TypeError` for non-boolean values (no truthy/falsy
   *   coercion). See 0.7.2 design § 2, § 13 Q1-Q4.

   *     bridge manages the Session Client from the page context. Zero CORS dependency.
   *   - Alternative path (Option 3 — opt-in via `useMarkupInjection=true`): fetches
   *     the creative HTML, pipes it through each extension's `injectIntoMarkup()`,
   *     and loads via `srcdoc`. Same-origin creative URLs only. Falls back to direct
   *     `src` if fetch fails, logging a warning. Useful for test environments and
   *     same-origin deployments.
   *   - Sandbox: `allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups` (no `allow-same-origin`,
   *     SEC-001).
   *
   * **Creative Markup** (`creativeSource === 'html'`, Phase B):
   *   - `iframe.src` = `creativeRendererUrl + '#sharcNonce=' + crypto.randomUUID()`.
   *   - Sandbox is granted `allow-same-origin` (safe — the renderer is cross-origin
   *     to the publisher, validated by construction-time rules 4–7) plus the
   *     SafeFrame-baseline tokens governed by the constructor `allowPopups` /
   *     `allowTopNavigationByUserActivation` / `allowStorageAccessByUserActivation` /
   *     `allowModals` / `allowDownloads` options. The unsafe `allow-top-navigation`
   *     token is never present.
   *   - Iframe `csp` (Chromium-only) and `allow` (Permissions Policy) attributes
   *     pin a default-deny baseline; the portable enforcement layer is the
   *     renderer's HTTP-response CSP.
   *   - On iframe `load`, posts `SHARC:Renderer:render` to the renderer (with
   *     pre-injected creative HTML), waits for `SHARC:Renderer:rendered` (envelope
   *     checks: source, origin, placementSessionId), then fires `initChannel`
   *     directly off that signal — event-driven, no wall-clock timer (ADR §5.0).

  /**

   * Runs FIRST in `_runMarkupInjection` (before any operator extensions), so
   * operator-supplied `extensions: [...]` see the markup with the SDK already
   * present.
   *
   * Position contract (4-step, locked 2026-05-17):
   *
   *   1. After `<head>` open tag — most specific. Token scanning rejects
   *      `<header>`, `<headers>`, comment-contained `<head>`, and `>` inside
   *      quoted attributes.
   *   2. After `<html>` open tag — same token-boundary defense against
   *      `<htmlfoo>` and similar non-`<html>` start sequences.
   *   3. After `<!DOCTYPE>` — fragment with doctype only. Inserting BEFORE the
   *      doctype pushes the browser into quirks-mode rendering, subtly breaking
   *      legacy creatives that rely on standards-mode layout. Explicit AFTER
   *      branch is the refinement (2026-05-17).
   *   4. Prepend — true fragment (no doctype, no `<html>`, no `<head>`).
   *
   * Idempotency: when `_creativeSdkSkipIfPresent` is true (default), markup
   * already containing a `<script src="...sharc-creative.js">` tag passes
   * through unchanged. The script-src context is required — bare substring
   * presence in comments, metadata, or inline-script text does NOT trigger
   * the skip (closes the silent-no-op footgun where a `<!-- sharc-creative.js -->`
   * comment caused the SDK to never load and bridge auto-install to time out).
   *
   * Regex contract (0.7.2 PR 4.1 round-4 fix):
   *
   *   /<script[^>]*(?<![\w.:-])src\s*=\s*["']?(?:[^"'\s>?#]*?\/)?sharc-creative\.js(?=[?#"'\s>]|$)/i
   *
   *   - `(?<![\w.:-])src` is a negative lookbehind that rejects attribute names
   *     ending in `src` like `data-src`, `xsrc`, `1src`, `foo_src`, `data.src`,
   *     `xml:src`, etc. The round-1 form used `\bsrc`, but `\b` fires after `-`
   *     (a non-word char), so `data-src=` matched. Round-2 closed `\b` with
   *     `(?<![\w-])`. Round-3 adds `.` and `:` — both are valid HTML5
   *     attribute-name continuation chars, so `data.src` and `xml:src` are
   *     parsed as single attribute names by browsers but the round-2 form
   *     still matched their trailing `src`. The lookbehind now requires the
   *     char before `src` to NOT be any of `[\w.:-]` — whitespace, `"`/`'`,
   *     `<`, etc. all pass. V8 has supported lookbehind since 2018 so this is
   *     fine for modern browsers/Node.
   *   - `["']?` makes the quote OPTIONAL — `<script src=https://cdn/sharc-creative.js>`
   *     is legal HTML and common in minified ad markup (the exact use case
   *     this option targets). The pre-fix regex required `["']` and missed it.
   *   - `(?:[^"'\s>?#]*?\/)?` is an optional path prefix that MUST end in `/`.
   *     This kills filename-collision false-positives like `notsharc-creative.js`,
   *     `foosharc-creative.js`, etc. — the prefix can't backtrack into the
   *     literal `sharc-creative.js` because it terminates with a slash. The
   *     round-4 fix excludes `?` and `#` from the prefix to close a query-
   *     string-slash bypass: `<script src="loader.js?next=/sharc-creative.js">`
   *     previously matched because the prefix happily consumed `loader.js?next=/`
   *     (the `?` and `=` weren't in the exclusion class). The real load there
   *     is `loader.js`; `sharc-creative.js` only appears in the query value.
   *     Restricting the prefix to URL-path characters (no `?` or `#`) means
   *     the regex only fires when `sharc-creative.js` is actually the
   *     filename being loaded.
   *   - `sharc-creative\.js` literal filename.
   *   - `(?=[?#"'\s>]|$)` lookahead asserts a filename boundary — query (`?`),
   *     fragment (`#`), closing quote, whitespace, `>`, or end-of-string. Kills
   *     extension-collision false-positives like `sharc-creative.js.map`.

   * Two `type` vocabularies are in play:
   *
   *   1. **Dev-channel `[type]` log tag** (the `internalType` argument). Seven

   *   2. **Structured-channel `event.type`** — six reserved values: five from
   *      proposal § Security Model line 715–723 (`renderer_origin_mismatch`,
   *      `renderer_protocol_error`, `renderer_failed`,
   *      `unauthorized_navigation`, `wrapper_top_frame_inaccessible`) plus
   *      `bridge_load_failed` added in 0.7.1 (issue #82). Both timeout
   *      (2114) and post-failed (2119) flow through the structured channel
   *      as `renderer_protocol_error` with a `details.subtype` discriminating
   *      timeout vs post-failed vs integrity-failed vs malformed-payload — the
   *      spec vocabulary has only one event type for renderer protocol
   *      failures, so we honor it. `bridge_load_failed` carries error code 2115 (same as
   *      `renderer_failed`) but gets its own `event.type` for operator
   *      observability — bridge import failures are a distinct deployment
   *      concern from creative-side render failures.
   *
   * Console output is prefixed with the `placementSessionId` (Compliance

   *

   * Three-layer API-framework detection pipeline (0.7.2 § 6). Resolves the

   *   1. Explicit `creativeMeta.apis` — pick highest-priority container-
   *      runtime code from the array per the priority ladder.
   *   2. Reserved no-op (future bid-context-derived detection).
   *   3. Fallthrough to `null`.

   *   - 2:           MRAID — `6` (3.0) > `5` (2.0) > `3` (1.0). Higher wins.
   *   - 3:           SafeFrame (`SAFEFRAME_API_CODE`)
   *
   * **Excluded from picker:**
   *   - OMID (`7`): measurement, not container runtime. § 6.4.
   *   - VPAID (`1`, `2`) and SIMID (`8`, `9`): video-creative protocols, not
   *     display-container runtimes. Operators read `creativeMeta.apis`
   *     directly if they need to branch on these. § 6.2.
   *   - Vendor codes (≥ 500): unrecognized; return `null`.
   *
   * Static so the constructor's resolution call doesn't need a `this`
   * reference (it runs before `this._apiFramework` is assigned).
